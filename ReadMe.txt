This application provides new drivers with a valuable tool to log their experiences, see their progress and generally, gain confidence behind the wheel.
The data is taken from the driver by user-friendly web form and saved in local storage.
The form has validation checks to make sure all the details are entered correctly. 
With Chart.js, it produces colored pie charts that show patterns of weather, traffic, etc.
It also automatically calculates total distance and driving hours, and creates graphs for them.
It sends congratulatory message when driver reaches 3000 kms because that is when the course is finished. 
The design adjusts well for both phones and desktops. 
It uses local storage to save data directly in the browser, so users don't need an internet connection or a backend server.
It's easy to use, visually clear, and very practical for any new driver who wants to track their driving progress.
The code is structured to be easy to maintain and add new features in the future, like exporting data or connecting to a server for wider use.
